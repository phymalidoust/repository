 - In $HOME, type:

nano .bashrc

 - Add the following lines to the bottom of that file:

# User specific aliases and functions
module use $HOME/modules

 - Save and exit .bashrc
 - back in $HOME, type:

mkdir modules

 - Then move into the new directory:

cd modules

 - Make another new directory inside of modules/:

mkdir gcc-7.3.0

 - Move into that directory now

cd gcc-7.3.0

 - Copy the GCC module file from my cwfs with the following command

cp /p/cwfs/scstarr/7.3.0 ./

 - GCC 7.3.0 will now be a loadable module in your Centennial environment

 - To switch to the new compiler option, do the following upon connecting to 
Centennial:

module swap compiler/intel gcc-7.3.0/7.3.0

 - You now should be able to compile spin_flip_2d on Centennial
